## 🎯 The Process in Simple Terms

**What you're about to do:**

1. **Put your code on GitHub**
   - GitHub = Cloud storage for code
   - Like Google Drive, but for developers

2. **Connect GitHub to Vercel**
   - Vercel = Hosting platform
   - Makes your code into a website

3. **Deploy!**
   - Vercel builds your app
   - Vercel puts it online
   - You get a URL

4. **Share your URL**
   - Your site is live!
   - Anyone can visit it

**That's it!** Simple, right?

## 💡 Why Vercel?

You might wonder: "Why not GoDaddy or other hosting?"

**Vercel is perfect for React apps because:**
- 🆓 **Free tier** (perfect for your project)
- ⚡ **Automatic** (push code = deployed)
- 🌍 **Global CDN** (fast worldwide)
- 🔒 **HTTPS included** (secure by default)
- 🚀 **Zero config** (just works)

**GoDaddy is better for:**
